# PdfChat_Application
Application using OpenAI and LangChain to chat with pdfs. This project is my ongoing work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> An interactive web application built with Streamlit and LangChain that allows you to chat with your PDF documents.

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a conversational interface for your PDF files. Upload your documents, and start asking questions!
